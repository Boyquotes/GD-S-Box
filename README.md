# [GD-S&Box or GD-SandBox]

*GD S&Box* is a sandbox game made in godot, the goal is to have a FPS that can be modded freely without decompilation. The plan is to have a folder structure with the exec that is read on launch of the game. Godot is intended to be a mod tool for this project an plugins may not work. This project *IS NOT USING GODOT MONO.*
